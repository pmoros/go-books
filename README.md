# Introduction

This project is a collection of exercises using the Go programming language. The exercises are taken from these books:

- Introducing Go by Caleb Doxsey
- The Go Programming Language by Alan A. A. Donovan and Brian W. Kernighan

The project also implements some GitHub Actions to run the tests and build the project. This collection of exercises is also used to learn how to use GitHub Actions and tries to implement some of the best practices, such as: DevOps, CI/CD, and TDD.
